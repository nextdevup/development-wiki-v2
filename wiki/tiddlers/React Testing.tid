''React Testing Library''

* Read through docs for any features you are using (lots of gotchas).
* UserEvents are suggested over FireEvents because UserEvents better mimics the behavior of an actual user.
* Similarly, toBeVisible is suggested over toBeInDocument because it better tests what the user can actually see.
* Also, should use something like toBeEnabled when checking if a button is available (vs just checking if button is found).
