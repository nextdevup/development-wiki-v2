* Avoid calling a function to get a component vs using component syntax because calling the function can cause more re-renders than necessary (always use <TestComponent /> vs invoking something like TestComponent()).
* Try to avoid defining functions directly in components (you can still define them in the same file). This adds more overhead because the function is torn down and re-created with a new reference when the component has to re-render.
