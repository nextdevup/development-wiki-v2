* Verify that the focus order of elements is correct.
* Changing focus should typically only be done based on user's request:
> Such as them clicking a "Contact Us" button which triggers focus to shift to the contact form at the bottom of a page.
> For cases where the user is being notified of something, such as an error message, it is typically better to use something like **aria-live="polite"** vs shifting their focus.
